// __________________________________________
// Reflection
1)What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
1)I learn that you have to know exactly on which object you want to treat, and I learn that it does makes things a bit more complex, so for us , it took more time.

2)Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
2)This was extremely hard for us, we actually used office hours twice in order to get to the final solution. We also build it very long, and I had a feeling that there is a better more useful shorter method to finish this challenge faster than we did, I wish I would know what it is.

3)What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
3)This one was the only challenge so far that I couldnâ€™t vision the target, I couldn't pseudocode to myself, and couldn't know what need to happen now. In most cases, I know what need to be done, I just don't know how to do it, hot to make my way of thinking into an actual code. This one, took me by surprise. to be completely honest, the understanding is still a bit in the air for me. This was a hard one!

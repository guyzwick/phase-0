# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# This challenge took me [#] hours.


# Pseudocode

#input: Array of number
#output: array with 'FizzBuzz replacing number that divide in 15, 
#'fizz' insted of number that divided by 3, and 'Buzz' insted of number that divide by 5 

# 1. creat an ampty array and call in 'new_array'
# 2.itrat over the originel_array and creat a if loop that have 4 trems.:
#  2.1 if the number  %is equel to 3 , it should replace it with the string 'Fizz' and place it in the new_ARRAY
#  2.2 elsif the number % is equel to 5 it should replace it with the stunf "buzz" and place it in the new_array
#  2.3 elsif the number % is equel to  15 it should replace it with the stirng 'FizzBuzz' and placed it in the new_array
#  2.4 else put the number in the new array
# 3.print the array

# Initial Solution

def super_fizzbuzz(array)
new_array=[]


end

super_fizzbuzz([1,2,3,4,5,6,15,30])

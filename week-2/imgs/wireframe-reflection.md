	•	What is a wireframe?
	•	Wireframe is a good way to build your site step by step. It let you view on how to do things in the right hierarchy. By defining which information is the most important, you will be able to wireframe in the right way according to the importance of the information hierarchy. 

	•	What are the benefits of wireframing?
	•	Being systematic about building complex structures always give you an advantage. In this case it is especially true, since many times there is allot of information we would like to present with our website. Wireframe is a grate tool to help you to define and build your site in the best way.

	•	Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
	•	It wasn’t a big joy for me, I would guess I would get more excitement if I were going into details.
	•	
	•	Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
	•	I did revise it. Once you have a second chance to think over thing, you have a place to make changes, and I have decided to makes some changes.

	•	What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
	•	I asked question such as “why did you choose this design different from others?, “Why is this frame is the best for you” must of them was answer on the spot, since there weren’t technical, they were based on personal preference.

	•	Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
	•	I enjoy the part that we had tried together different tools on how to frame, and that we could ‘brain-storm’ and build cool things together. I did’t find any parts tedious.

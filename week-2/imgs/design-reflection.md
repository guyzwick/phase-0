	2.	 The six phases in Web design are: Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery, Maintenance. This 6 stages were written by Selene M. Bowlby. By using this six stages, the designer can layout his work in a neater way, and focus on differ aspect in each different phase. Having a good plan is the different between success and a failure. 

	1.	What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
	2.	My site main idea is to Expose myself, my work and my thought about life to different web developers, mostly recruiters, but also people that share my agenda. the site will have different context, starting from telling about myself, if it is with my blog or if it is with a written intro. Another layout is different links, Ideas, aspect that I believe in and want to share with the world. and lastly social links like Facebook, Linkedin and github

	1.	What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
	2.	For now the main audience is member from the developer community, especially recruiters. Another aspect is people that are sharing my agenda, or like my written word or different links that I will post

	1.	What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
	2.	I would say that there is two main keys action I will build my website for; The first one is just to browse around, gather information, observe the different work I post and of course my CV, the second action, If the user would like to ‘go dipper in the rabbit hole’, he will be able to reply, share, he can ‘like’ a video or a picture or a post, and even to be more involve by writing and sharing their opinion

	1.	What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
	2.	design in website developed means to make easy access, nice and neat look, comfortable browse experience. Know the right audience and how to address them in the best way. To know the right balance between showing information and over-informative site.

	1.	What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
	2.	User experience is one, if not the most, important part of the web developed. To make sure that the user have a good, interesting, easy experience while browsing on your website, is our true goal. It is also to share the information we have on our site, but if it is too hard and Massey, nobody would like to get that information that our website is offering, That is why, the user experience is the core element, the vision that the developer should keep on asking himself; ”how would the user like what I am doing now? would he like it? would he hate it? this is the questions that should drives us while we are creating our site.

	1.	Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
	2.	I am really sorry, but I would lie if I would say that I find one of this challenge parts is tedious, I actually really like this concept, and enjoyed all the necessary information involved.

What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

It is hard for me to put my finger on a specific concept, but the all idea of the connection between the terminal to the Github site was a little off for me. now, after I had experienced using many time with ‘pull’ ,’merge’,’touch’ I understand how it’s work

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I was clarified about the ‘push origin branch name’ ,now I understand the logic behind that. I know that it is possible to push only after your computer ‘pull’ before, and that’s what makes u and the master on the same page.
		
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I had technical question regarding on how to execute the challenge. I understand before the challenge how it works, now I not only understand the general concept, I know exactly how it works.

What still confuses you about git?
One thing that’s still trick me is when you go from your terminal to Github, u can’t link on any directory, it have to be a specific directory( add list that’s what I think …?) vs linking any directory to github whenever u want.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was nice and I liked it. It really help by making thing more clear. two is always better then one, that’s what I think, and in the peer meeting, it is an opportunity to learn from one another.

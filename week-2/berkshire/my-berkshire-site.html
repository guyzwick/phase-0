    <!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I liked this experience since I like HTML. It was cool to see because you really feel like you can create, and you see how HTML is a great tool and easy to use, and the option of using it is tremendous.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was cool, because there are many sources and we could solve our problems easily. I think that the 5th version is easier then the rest
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think we did good, we didn’t had any formatting problem. I am sorry that I can not add on this questions, it seams that there is nothing to add.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
good: easy to use, you can almost write what you think. many sources to uses. Bad: it can get frustrating to open and close all the time the <>.
but that’s okay.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Keep a list on ‘note’ of all the main commands.

      • What are the benefits of version control?
      • the benefits of version control is by letting you try and error with the code without the danger that you will harm the original code. how can you ever try something new if you won’t have version control? Properly you won’t. Version control is giving the artist the option to fill confident and good the right environment that he need in order to crate art. Imagine that the artist was holding a brush in his hand, thinking what to paint, looking on the naked canvas in front of him and instead of start coloring, he is only afraid to harm the older painting or damage his old art. This is where version control kick in. it let you go wild, experiment, try something new.

      • How does git help you keep track of changes?
      • Git helps you keep track on the changing by saving each one of them, and saving them as rough draft until they are ready. Git will save each rough draft in your computer until they are ready to move to the next stage. It is good to know that it is on your computer, and nobody can see, and you are the only one that have access to that.

      • Why use GitHub to store your code?
      • Without any doubt, Github is  strong instrument that help communicate between different developer, and shows your ideas, your art, and create a conversation between developer about the code. In this way, people can be inspire, or can have access to new ideas, or find others that have the missing part that they don’t have. developers can also value other on the good of their work, and how good they code.

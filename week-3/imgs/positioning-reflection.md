	•	How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
	•	Chrome’s Developers tools were really awesome. They really show the ‘big’ picture, they let you see all you changes right away. I will use them again in the future. There were also easy to use.

	•	How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
	•	U can reshape the element by changing the mergers you want using: height, width attributes. 
	•	
	•	What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult? 
	•	Absolute, is a ’strong’ key, it means that the element will follow your order regardless to the other elements. Fixed means that you don’t want to leave space for this element, insured you want to place it the closest the the new element. Relative means that it will lays out this elements with the consideration go the other elements that have not yet been position. I would say that the easiest to use is of-course the absolute, and the hardest is relative, since your taking all the other elements into consideration. This was true in my case too, but ‘practice makes perfect’ try and error is the name of the game, in the end I got the hang of it.

	•	What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
	•	So, The space outside and between the elements is the margin.  this area would also be outside of any borders. margin is the space around of the element from border outwards. padding is space around (inside) the element from text to border.

	•	What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
	•	I loved it, we did got a bit stock for a while there, but I think we learn allot by doing it.

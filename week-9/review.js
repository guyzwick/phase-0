// // 1)What concepts did you solidify in working on this challenge?
// // 1)I clear up a bit more what itâ€™s meant to iterate in JS. I also understand more when is the right time in your code
//  to add an empty variable and use it to modify code.

// // 2)What was the most difficult part of this challenge?
// // 2)I would say that the hardest part was to execute my pseudocode. What I mean is, just to see how to write the code
//  and make it work, because this problem wasn't that hard to understand.


// // 3)Did you solve the problem in a new way this time?
// // 3)The truth is, that it was very similar and the same principle it would be as solving it in ruby.


// // 4)Was your pseudocode different from the Ruby version? What was the same and what was different?
// // 4)It was the same mostly, not many changes. this is not that hard to understand, and pretty straight forward.

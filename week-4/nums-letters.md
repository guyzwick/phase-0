What does puts do?
Puts is standing for ‘put a string’. Now, if you are asking yourself what is a ‘string’ here is a nice answer :”A String object in Ruby holds and manipulates an arbitrary sequence of one or more bytes, typically representing characters that represent human language.”(http://www.tutorialspoint.com/). We are basically saying to computer to print something out on when we run the program.


What is an integer? What is a float?
Integer is a full number, it's a number without decimal point, for an example: 1 , 2 and so on .. A float number is a number that is not ‘full’ for example: 1.6, 9.9 or 3,141679039


What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
the main difference is based for which question or which need do you need you answer . for instance; if you are making a program that should handle money, and should give change, you will need to use float for this job, because you have to give the exact amount of change. But, if you are using a different program, lets be creative and say where are building a program that help you planned your vacation per the amount of money you want to spend, in this case you have to use 
integer, because you cannot say to someone that he will have 0.5 a ride, or 0.5 of a ticket.

	•	How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
	•	Ruby is great with doing all that, Aldo Chris Pine said that we should not reliant on Ruby mat skills. I didn’t had problem with it, and it looks like it perform my math command in a 100%.

	•	What is the difference between integers and floats?
	•	Well, Integer is a full number, it's a number without decimal point, for an example: 1 , 2 and so on .. A float number is a number that is not ‘full’ for example: 1.6, 9.9 or 3.141679039

	•	What is the difference between integer and float division? 
	•	In a division integer will not leave numbers after the point, and float will. 
	•	What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
	•	”A String object in Ruby holds and manipulates an arbitrary sequence of one or more bytes, typically representing characters that represent human language.”(http://www.tutorialspoint.com/). We are basically saying to the computer to print something out on when we run the program. They are very important, you can say that they are the core-blocking-block we used to build many thing in Ruby. They like ‘words’ on the ruby language which we use to build sentences and paregraph

	•	What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?				
	•	“local variables.... This means they live inside the method, and they cannot leave. If you try, you will get an error:”( Learn to program by Chris Pine) We create many new variables while we program, most of them are local variable, we need them in our math equation and in different function in Ruby. 
	•	How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
	•	Well, it took me a while to finish it, but I always try to remind myself that practice makes perfect. I did, it is some time since I did Ruby with Codecademy, so this challenge brought me back in shape.

What does puts do?
Puts is standing for ‘put a string’. Now, if you are asking yourself what is a ‘string’ here is a nice answer :”A String object in Ruby holds and manipulates an arbitrary sequence of one or more bytes, typically representing characters that represent human language.”(http://www.tutorialspoint.com/). We are basically saying to computer to print something out on when we run the program.


What is an integer? What is a float?
Integer is a full number, it's a number without decimal point, for an example: 1 , 2 and so on .. A float number is a number that is not ‘full’ for example: 1.6, 9.9 or 3,141679039


What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
the main difference is based for which question or which need do you need you answer . for instance; if you are making a program that should handle money, and should give change, you will need to use float for this job, because you have to give the exact amount of change. But, if you are using a different program, lets be creative and say where are building a program that help you planned your vacation per the amount of money you want to spend, in this case you have to use 
integer, because you cannot say to someone that he will have 0.5 a ride, or 0.5 of a ticket.

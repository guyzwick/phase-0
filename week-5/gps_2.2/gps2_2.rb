What did you learn about pseudocode from working on this challenge?

I learn that pseudocode is a key-element in how to solve the problem. I also learned that it is okay, and smart to sometimes go back and change your code, add more detail and change it.

What are the tradeoffs of using Arrays and Hashes for this challenge?
In order to create the desire list that the challenge is asking, you will need to use hashes. Hashes have a key and value, this why they are more appropriate for this challenge. In this challenges we need to have item and item quantity, this why hash could be the only tool to fit for this job.

What does a method return?
A method return the final result, the final answer after all the process is done.

What kind of things can you pass into methods as arguments?
You can pass integer, array, and you can use call upon a different method. not her local variables that are in a different method, the method itself. 

How can you pass information between methods?
This is one of the trickiest part that I have learn from this method, you can collaborate between methods outside the method. in order to make two methods cooperate, you may use command also outside of those two methods so they will run together, it is hard to explain in words, but when you are writing the code, you need to choose what is right to write inside the method, and what is good outside. 

What concepts were solidified in this challenge, and what concepts are still confusing?
the concepts is still confusing because I need to get use to using it more, I am talking about the concept I was describing above, that you need to choose what is right to write inside the method, and what is right to write outside of the method.
